# :microscope: CytoData - 2018 Challenge 

The CytoData 2018 Challenge features batch effect correction and cross dataset profile matching :cd: :twisted_rightwards_arrows: :dvd:. 
The challenge involves the transformation of signatures using machine learning :space_invader: or statistical methods :bar_chart:. 
You will be given two datasets of image-based signatures :cd: :heavy_plus_sign: :dvd: acquired at different times :date: :clock130: and with different experimental conditions :pill: :syringe: with the goal of retrieving correct matches accurately :dart:. 
See http://cytodata.org/ for more details.

# :tv: Background

:alien: *: What is image-based profiling?*

:sunglasses: : In the study of biological systems, microscopy images are used to measure the response of cells to treatments or perturbations. 
Cell state can be observed and quantitatively measured using images by following a computational workflow known as profiling. 
Single cells are first identified in all images, and then their main characteristics are represented in feature vectors.
The information of a population of cells is aggregated into a single vector, also called profile, containing summary statistics of the features of all cells.
These profiles encode the morphological changes of cell populations exposed to treatments.
Image-based profiles can be used to compare the response of cells to different treatments, and to map their similarities.

:alien: *: Is image-based profiling the same as image-based screening?*

:sunglasses: :


:alien: *: What are the applications of image-based profiling?*

:sunglasses: : Image-based profiles can be used for drug discovery and functional genomics applications. 
There are many types of biological studies that can be conducted using image-based profiling.
For a review of research studies using images, see the following paper.
In the CytoData challenge, we will explore image-based profiles obtained from chemical and genetic screens (see Data below).

:alien: *: What imaging assays can be used for profiling?*

:sunglasses: : Virtually any imaging assay can be used for profiling. High-content assays can be used for profiling
