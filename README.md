# CytoData - 2018 Challenge :microscope:

The CytoData 2018 Challenge features batch effect correction and cross dataset profile matching :cd: :twisted_rightwards_arrows: :dvd:. 
The challenge involves the transformation and normalization of signatures using machine learning :robot_face: or statistical methods :bar_chart:. 
You will be given two datasets of image-based signatures :barcode: acquired at different times :date: :clock130: and with different experimental conditions :pill: :syringe: with the goal of retrieving correct matches accurately :dart:. 
You may select a team of scientists to design a solution, and you will have 48 hours to refine it into a winning entry. Find more details at http://cytodata.org/.
