# cytodata-hackathon-2018
Come and participate in the CytoData 2018 Challenge in Boston, featuring batch effect correction and cross dataset profile matching. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, involves the transformation and normalization of signatures using machine learning or statistical methods. You will be given two datasets of image-based signatures acquired at different times and with different experimental conditions with the goal of retrieving correct matches accurately. You may select a team of scientists to design a solution, and you will have 48 hours to refine it into a winning entry. Find more details at http://cytodata.org/.
